 <hr/>
 <h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
 <p>This movie had some of the best action sequences and it wrapped up a 10 year journey with so many characters in a really amazing and emotional way.</p>
 <h3>The Avengers</h3>
 <p>The first Avengers movie will always be on my top 3 list of best movies as it has some of the best lines and interactions with the starting heros of the MCU.</p>
 <h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
 <p>This movie made me laugh so much, and I have watched it almost four times since the movie released in theaters.</p>
